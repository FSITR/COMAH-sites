# COMAH-sites
## Purpose
- This notebook provides a very basic demonstration of clustering.
## Introduction and backround information
- COMAH sites are engineering facilities containing hazardous material and are at risk of causing major accidents.
  - e.g. nuclear power plants or chemical plants.
- Approximatly 1800 COMAH sites exist across the UK.
- COMAH stands for "Control Of Major Accident Hazards".
## Problem statement
- We want to understand if our COMAH sites fall into any natural groupings.
- We will base these groupings solely on geographical data to illustrate how clustering alogirthms work.
## Data
- COMAH site postcodes.
- UK postcode longitude and latitude.
## Algorithms used
- Two clustering algorithms are used; K-Means and DBSCAN.
